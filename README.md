# HEXRGB-FNDR
Final project- This program allows you to add a list of colors with thier corresponding values and be able to type in the colors you want and get the hex or rgb values. I will be adding more to this code in the future. 

Project Title: HEXRGB FNDR
Description: This program will allow the user to type in a color and the program will output the hex value or rgb value of the color they chose. 
Outline:
-	The user will be greeted “Hello”
-	User will be asked to enter their name
o	User will be asked to choose a color (red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and violet)
	User will ask to choose whether they want the hex or rgb values for their chosen color
•	The user is then viewed with the hex/rgb value of the color they chose 

-	If they want to choose another color, a while loop is added to the program to ensure that if they would like to chose another color, the program will re-loop back to the first request where they asked the user to enter their name. 

-	If the user types “no” to the question if they want to choose another color, the program will simply thank them for using the program and exit
